  - "DAD#[static]...one sec, got to make sure it\u2019s tuned to the channel\u2026"
  - JX#Here, let me adjust my own feed, too!
  - JX#TURN THE TUNING DIAL
  - DAD#There we go. Nice and clear now.
  - MOM#You look tired, sweetie. Is everything alright?
  - "JX#I\u2019m okay, I think."
  - "JX#I\u2019ve got three exams coming up this week,"
  - "JX#But I\u2019ll be done soon enough."
  - "DAD#That\u2019s quite the workload!"
  - "MOM#I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get through it\u2013you always do!"
  - MOM#Just be sure to keep getting enough sleep.
  - "MOM#I know it\u2019s hard with so much going on all at once."
  - JX#Thanks, mom.
  - "JX#I\u2019m trying to stick to my daily planner, and that\u2019s helped with
    sleep and diet."
  - MOM#What exams are you studying for?
  - JX#Well, I have to take a translation certification for Alluvien,
  - "JX#An advanced Hygri grammar test\u2026"
  - JX#And the STALE, of course.
  - "MOM#Oh, stars\u2026I remember having trouble with my own Alluvien exams back
    in the day."
  - MOM#Which one are you most worried about?
  - JX#Haha, definitely the Alluvien one.
  - "JX#It\u2019s a literary passage, so it has all kinds of metaphors in it."
  - "MOM#Oh, sure\u2013those are pretty tricky!"
  - "JX#The STALE is going to be stressful, too, but not because it\u2019s hard."
  - "JX#There\u2019s just a lot riding on getting at least a decent score."
  - JX#Companies use lower STALE scores to weed out applications,
  - JX#even if the applicants are really good at speaking other languages.
  - MOM#The STALE never changes, does it?
  - 'DAD#Speaking for both of us: we know you can do it.'
  - "DAD#You\u2019ve always been our star student."
  - "MOM#And you\u2019ll be a star no matter where you end up."
  - "DAD#Speaking of\u2026I bet you\u2019re excited for the job offers to be announced."
  - DAD#Any word from the inside? Any ConCorp reps floating around?
  - JX#Not yet.
  - "JX#I\u2019ve seen a few new people flying in from off-system, but it\u2019s
    hard to tell who they are."
  - "JX#It\u2019s pretty exciting here, though. Everyone seems ready to finish up
    the semester."
  - "MOM#I\u2019ll bet! It\u2019s been a long wait and a lot of work for all of you."
  - DAD#What about CF? How is he doing?
  - "JX#He\u2019s been busy with applications for internships,"
  - JX#and his marketing and advertising projects are taking up the rest of his time.
  - JX#We still get together to work on our schoolwork, though.
  - "JX#It\u2019s nice to have someone to keep me on task!"
  - "DAD#He\u2019s got a bright future ahead of him, I\u2019m sure."
  - "DAD#That kid has a knack for making friends\u2013he always has."
  - MOM#Oh! Have you seen the new ads for the Carmine settlement?
  - JX#The holoboard ones?
  - DAD#Yes, those ones!
  - DAD#We were on the public transit shuttle to work the other day and one popped
    up.
  - JX#Yeah, I saw them.
  - "JX#\u201COne of a Kind Carmine.\u201D"
  - DAD#It has a nice ring to it.
  - "JX#I\u2019m so excited! They say the new terrariums ConCorp installed on the
    surface are up and running."
  - JX#And the Alluvienne Quarter will be starting its night market soon!
  - JX#There always seems to be something interesting happening there.
  - "MOM#It\u2019s good to hear you so excited about this opportunity,"
  - "MOM#and I\u2019m sure that excitement will come through if they look at your
    application!"
  - "MOM#You\u2019ve always made sure that-\r\n"
